### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Research Data Scientist at [The Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk), working as part of the [Research Engineering Group](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-engineering). Most of the time, I focus on adopting and adapting Natural Language Processing methods across a wide range of Humanities and Social Science research projects.

I'll add other things soon - for the moment there's some old stuff in [here](https://federiconanni.com/)
